Software application monitoring script constantly checks the software processes and when it detects that one of those processes has stopped working, it will automatically send an email* alert to the designated person.

It is developed keeping in mind all those admin and power users who use programs that must always be running (such as webserver, database, mailserver, p2p) and that don't have a built-in restart function.

### TESTING APPROACH ###

A.  Go to any website to extract data from e.g. http://businessfinder.mlive.com/

B.  Type "Audit" as the search keyword.

F.  Modifications to the scripts may be made easily.

### THIRD-PARTY REQUIREMENTS ###

1.  The web data extraction process rely on an external application called Automation Anywhere (http://http://www.automationanywhere.com).  The easiest way to install Automation Anywhere on a Windows computer is to download the software from http://http://www.automationanywhere.com/download/freeTrial.htm.

2.  Copy both script files into the folder: "My Documents\Automation Anywhere\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks".  For example: "C:\Users\Photoshop\Documents\Automation Anywhere Files\Automation Anywhere\My Tasks"

A)  Data_Harvesting.atmx
 
B)  Data_Harvesting.atmr

You will be able to see the saved script in the Automation Anywhere's task pane.  Now you can run the ACL script to call the script in Automation Anywhere to perform the web data extraction.

<blockquote>Automation Anywhere scripting is easy to learn and can the learning curve of the person from programming background such as VB, C, C++, java, .Net, etc. will be much smaller and can trained faster.</blockquote>
